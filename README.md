Yahoo Finance Stock Gainers Scraper

A Python script that retrieves and displays information about the top stock gainers from the Yahoo Finance website. The script utilizes the requests library for making HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup for web scraping.

How It Works

The script performs the following steps:

    Sends a GET request to the Yahoo Finance page listing the top stock gainers.
    Parses the HTML content of the page using BeautifulSoup.
    Extracts information about each stock, including the company name, symbol, stock price change, and percentage change.
    Prints the extracted information for each stock.
